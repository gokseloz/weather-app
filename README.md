## Weather-App
- It is a current weather-app made by following a tutorial by Dev Ed
    - In the tutorial Darksky API is used but it is no longer available for free!!!
    - Thats why I used `OpenWeatherMap API`
- The app firstly asks permission for location determnation and then shows the weather condition and some info

## What else did I add besides original project?
- a feature that shows current date
    - days and months arrays are created to reach the names of them as it is not possible directly from `new Date()`, 

## Why did I do this?
- To learn how to work with API

## What did I learn from this project?
- get user's location with `geolocation API`
- `navigator.geolocation` ask the user for permission via browser
- receive the location of device with `geolocation.getCurrentPosition`
- `fetch API`
    
## Notes
- My first API projects, it was fun to play around with all datas from API
- I will try to develop this app to add more features, maybe another API that also shows hours and other days

## How did I do this?
### Technologies
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript

### Responsivity
- Fully Responsive

## Live demo
- [See live demo](https://weather-app-ruby-theta.vercel.app/)
